# Wage Growth, Inflation & Economic Inequality (2015‚Äì2024)

## üìå Project Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between **wage growth, inflation, unemployment, and economic inequality** in the United States from **2015 to 2024**. Using publicly available economic data, we examined how rising costs of living, wage disparities, and productivity shifts have impacted employment and overall economic stability.

The project was developed as part of a hackathon challenge, where our team aimed to turn raw datasets into meaningful insights with clear visualizations and policy implications.

## üìà Key Insights

* Wage growth increased steadily, but **inflation spikes (2021‚Äì2023)** eroded real incomes.
* A strong **inverse relationship** was observed between wage growth and unemployment, except for anomalies during post-pandemic recovery.
* **Inequality widened** as wage stagnation disproportionately impacted the bottom 50%, while inflation benefited wealth concentration at the top.
* **Productivity growth peaked in 2021** (2.1%) but declined afterward, suggesting reduced efficiency gains.
